opening: |
  You're with Pooh on the hunt for some "hunny."
  Luckily, some of his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood know where to find it.
  You might need to win against them in a friendly game of tic-tac-toe, though, before they tell you its whereabouts.
   
dialogue: |
  And I know a marvelous game!
  It's called "tic-tac-toe".
  
rules: |
  POOH:
  It's quite simple, really.
  You and a friend will take turns placing your markers in any empty square.
  The first one with three markers in a row wins!
   
difficulty: |
    Would you like to play it easy or are you looking for a challenge?
    
    [1] Go easy on me! (EASY GAMEPLAY)
    [2] I'd like a challenge! (DIFFICULT GAMEPLAY)

lose: |
  What a shame.
  No hunny for you this time.

goodbye: |
  POOH:
  Come back soon! I'm always on the hunt for hunny.
  See, the only reason for being a bee is to make hunny.
  And the only reason for making hunny is so I can eat it.
  G'bye!
